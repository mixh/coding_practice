// You are given a positive integer array skill of even length n where skill[i] denotes the skill of the ith player. Divide the players into n / 2 teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.

// The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.

// Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return -1 if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]
// Output: 22
// Explanation: 
// Divide the players into the following teams: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), where each team has a total skill of 6.
// The sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: 1 * 5 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22.
